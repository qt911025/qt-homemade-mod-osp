# qt-homemade-mod-osp

A Mount & Blade Warband mod in which I put experimental features.

## To use it
Run `sh ./Sources/build_modules.sh` (Linux) or
`build_modules.bat` (Windows)

It will be failed for missing IDs. Build it again.
If it still doesn't work, create a new `build_modules.sh` and copy contents of the old one into it.(Linux)

Then copy language files from Native to the language folder in this mod.

Enjoy it!
