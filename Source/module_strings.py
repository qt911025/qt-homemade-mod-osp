Once a bright eyed merchant who arrived at Tihr with a small fortune in rubies and a dream to corner the velvet market, he was soon reduced to a pauper, having lost everything to cutthroat competition with the colluding Rhodok merchant guilds. But he soon turned measuring scales into swords, and applied his considerable business smarts into building up the deadliest criminal enterprise in Veluca, with hideouts and operations in every major town. He has attained his goal, for the price on his head is greater than the riches he once pursued. Now he takes great pleasure in relieving his former competitors of their worldly goods -?and worries."),
  ("quick_battle_troop_2", "Usiatra usurped leadership of the group of bandits that occupied Siri, a rural village in the southern deserts outside the realm of Calradia, in a curt and bloody fashion when she was seventeen years old. Under her direction, the band of ruffians quickly expanded their operations across the southlands. Her shrewd, decisive manner, combined with her merciless ambition which she acts upon with inhuman composure and cruelty, garners fanatic admiration from those that follow her. As such, amongst her own she lives a decadent, spoilt lifestyle -- built upon the violent plundering she exacts in her travels. Her military strength and natural strategic wit allowed her outfit to remain undealt with in her homeland, and now she turns her eye towards the rich lands of Calradia to sustain her war band."),
  ("quick_battle_troop_3", "The second son of a minor noble living near Uxkhal, Hegen was educated in the art of war and single combat. After being knighted he served as a paid knight in the army of the lord of Uxkhal and fought against the Vaegirs before leading a group of outriders that defeated a Khergit raid near Amere. The ensuing counter raid and the following two campaigns earned him glory and fame as a warrior. Unfortunately, he lost any chance of further prestige when peace was declared and he was discharged. With no hope of inheriting and his skills at war languishing in peace, he assembled other young warriors and set out as a mercenary captain. He now hopes to take advantage of the fact that Calradia never lacks warring states in need of mercenaries."),
  ("quick_battle_troop_4", "Konrad is a professional mercenary from the distant land of Balion, far beyond the vast western ocean. Having spent most of his years on campaign and seen countless battles, Konrad has grown to love his life as a soldier of fortune. Though he once had his nose flattened by a mace blow and has received many wounds, he has nevertheless survived this harsh existence through the strength of his arm, innate cunning and pure luck. Hearing of the lucrative career opportunities awaiting a man of his talents in Calradia, Konrad chartered a vessel and crossed the sea with his men in search of new wars to fight in. A sellsword with no ties to any of the Calradian states, he is more than happy to offer his services to any lord with a fat enough coin-purse."),
  ("quick_battle_troop_5", "Sverre is one of the so-called sea raiders -- freebooters and lawless men from the icy realm of Jumne beyond the North Sea, also said to be the ancestral home of the Nords. Already as a young man he has been along on many raids against both his distant cousins in the Wercheg region and the Vaegirs. However, Sverre was always a sharp lad, and it didn't take him long to see that Calradia was a far more prosperous land than his own, and that he could have a better life here than among his own people. During a raid on Jayek, Sverre stole away while his comrades were busy looting the village and taking captives. Passing himself off as a yokel from the Chalbek mountains, Sverre quickly built up a reputation for himself as a fierce fighter, and he now seeks his fortune at the head of a mercenary band."),

For all of his life he has tracked the beasts of the wild for their meat and fur, living off the land just as his forefathers had done in happier days, before the endless wars. Now, the game is quick to take fright from the constant sounds of battle, and the wanton slaughter of animals by soldiers has left empty those forests that have not been burnt down. Facing starvation, Borislav chose to turn his great skill with bow and spear, learned from hunting stag, wolf, and bear, to the practice of hunting men, and his steady hand and keen eye have claimed many lives. Borislav does not care much for the disputes of kingdoms, and is only really interested in keeping himself and his men fed."),
  ("quick_battle_troop_7", "Stavros was born in the independent city-state of Zendar, and spent much of his adult life serving in the town watch under the famous constable Hareck. Stavros' leadership and prowess were instrumental in ridding the area of the dreaded river pirates, but even he was powerless against the calamity that befell the city. When Zendar was razed to the ground by a great horde of sea raiders, Stavros fled the burning city in a crowd of refugees. After a brief period of wandering and odd jobs, he found a place in a mercenary company, eventually rising to become its leader due to his dedication and tactical aptitude. He now devotes most of his efforts to working with manhunters and local authorities against the sea raiders and other outlaws, trying to keep the land safe for travelers."),
  ("quick_battle_troop_8", "Growing up with one of the nomadic tribes deep in the desert beyond Sarranid lands, Gamara learned early on how to hunt with sling and spear. However, the simple life and pitiless conditions in the desert did not satisfy her, and she burned with a desire to see the great world beyond that she had heard so many wondrous tales about. Life is not easy for an adventuring young woman, and Gamara had to learn the ways of Calradia quickly. Taking the weapons and armor of a soldier who had attacked her after a dispute, Gamara now hides her beauty under thick Sarranid garb, and many never even suspect she is a woman ? certainly as a force on the battlefield she is as dangerous as any man. She has gathered about her a group of followers, and together they wander the war-torn land in search of glory."),
  ("quick_battle_troop_9", "Aethrod is not a noble person. He's changed his name twice, and is blamed for most of the crimes on Vaegir territory. True or not, he claims to never have taken an innocent man's life, and considers himself a patriotic citizen, several times bringing his band or renegades to the assistance of his faction, when it is threatened. In times of peace, however, most lords must be careful when he is in the vicinity due to his daring personality and willingness to challenge a lord. Born and rasied in the slums of Reyvadin, he learned how to use a bow at an early age and ran away from home a fourteen. Now at thirty two, his archery skills are near perfect and though he can't ride a horse well, he can hit one at the furthest of distances. Tough as nails and sharp as a hawk, he is a true local legend."),
  ("quick_battle_troop_10", "Being the daughter of one of the most infamous bandit leaders in the Sarranid realm isn't always easy, but Zaira seems to have managed quite well. Unlike most women she grew up learning the ways of the desert warrior and is deadly with the sword as well as the bow. While the other girls her age learned how to manage the household, Zaira learned how to best gut a merchant before taking his money. At the age of sixteen Zaira had killed more men than the average veteran in the Sultan's army. Just before her twentieth brithday her father was killed in brawl with another bandit leader. As the only child, Zaira now took control of her father's band. After avenging her father, she quickly picked up where he had left. Now she's on a good way of establishing her own reputation has a bandit leader."),
  ("quick_battle_troop_11", "Argo Sendnar had quite a diversified life. When he arrived at Calradia, working as a trader, he hoped for more income than in Lokti. Little did he know, that the wartorn Calradia was a wasps' nest for bandits and cutthroats that made trading a lot more complicated than in Lokti. Being bought out by another competeting trader, after losing all his goods and money due to caravan raids, he was forced to serve as a caravan guard to make a living.

The riches of the land draw the traders, but the traders in turn draw bandits.

Occasionally, too, you catch sight of one of the great warhorses that are the pride of the Swadian nobility. The land here is rich -- but also troubled, as the occasional burnt-out farm bears witness.

You knew that you were relatively safe at sea, as you were too far south to risk encountering the sea raiders who trouble the coasts of the Nordic lands, but it was still a relief to reach the Selver estuary, gateway to the port of Jelkala, and see a Rhodok galley riding at anchor, its pennants fluttering in the evening breeze."),

It was some relief when your ship came in sight of the delta of the Vyl and Boluk rivers, and a short while later, rowed past tidal flats and coastal marshes to the city of Sargoth, home to the Sea Raiders' distant kinsmen, the Nordic lords, who a few generations ago had carved themselves a kingdom in this rich but troubled land."),

The passes were still choked with snow, and it was hard going, but at last you crested a ridge and saw before you the Calradian steppes. On some hillsides the thin grass of spring was already turning yellow, but the lower slopes of the mountains were still a vibrant green. Herds of sheep and tawny steppe ponies drifted across them like clouds, testifying to the wealth of the Khergit khans. From time to time small groups of horsemen would follow your caravan from a distance, perhaps sizing up how well you could defend the wealth you carried, so it was with some relief that you saw the towers of Tulga rising up from the plains."),

Your great fear was that the caravan might lose its way and perish of thirst. The small bands of raiders who hovered just out of bowshot, waiting to pick off stragglers, were oddly a comfort -- at least water could be no more than a day's ride away.
